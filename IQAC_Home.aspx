The Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) has been established by Eastern University in July of 2015.  The Cell got a boost with a grant from the HEQEP program of the University Grants Commission.  The authorities of Eastern University have expressed total commitment to the project which has the ultimate goal of developing a quality culture within the University.  Articulation of this goal is quite consistent with the prevalent policy of Eastern University stating that when it comes to quality in teaching, we will make no compromise.<br /><br />
Quality Assurance is not just about teaching, rather it is about a culture within the university that strives to improve quality at all aspects, at all levels, of the university programs, processes, and objectives.  We see this as a continuous process of improving quality with no finish line.  <br /><br />
At this point, IQAC of Eastern University is focused on self-assessment of the Faculty of Business Administration and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.  The Faculty of Laws and Faculty of Engineering will soon undertake self-assessment. In the mean time, IQAC of Eastern University has invited several international scholars and organized several seminars and workshops to train the faculty members on developing effective, student friendly, mission consistent course descriptions, on conducting interactive classes, teaching through cases, etc.  Further, several seminars were dedicated toward developing research skills of the faculty members.<br /><br />
We have developed a complete year-long program of seminars and workshops and we invite you to visit our website frequently to get the latest updates.  Drop by at the IQAC office at House # 3, Road # 3 office if you have any questions.  Hope to see you there.<br /><br />

                                     To finish something is not as easy as to start it. Realization, motivation and commitment might be the driving forces to be stick to something crucial for life and society. Introduction of Quality Assurance Culture in higher education sectors of Bangladesh is such kind of inevitable task that must be implemented based on concrete vision, mission and achievement. <br /><br />
However, in order to drive the Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), Eastern University has taken extensive programs and initiatives for the teachers, students and staffs to train up how to achieve and assess quality of the university in terms of teaching & learning, support & facilities and services. Eastern University has commitment to be the pioneer of implementing practice of Quality Assurance by introducing informative and substantial Self Assessment framework and facts. <br /><br />
At this point, IQAC of Eastern University is working at full swing on implementing Internal Self Assessment at program level and looking forward to make a successful report within specified timeframe. Meanwhile, the departments have already adopted effective steps to accommodate their curricula, teaching-learning strategy and teaching capacity to be consistent with the outcome-based modern and diverse education. <br /><br />
Finally, it would be worthwhile to note that the upcoming environment in Eastern University is the Quality Assurance Culture as devotions of all of the stake holders working hand to hand. <br /><br />

As sharing of mutual ideas and knowledge’s is the key to successful accomplishment of IQAC, we will appreciate your comments and/or suggestions.                                     <br />
