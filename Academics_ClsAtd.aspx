                             A student is expected to attend all classes in a course. All students are required to be present in at least 80% of the classes including tutorial classes held, to sit for the final examination. For example, if there are 26 classes and 13 tutorial /lab etc. of a course in a semester, the percentage of attendance will be computed out of 39. If a student fails to attend 80% classes of a course, s/he will not be allowed to sit for the final exam. It is the responsibility of the students to keep course teachers informed of his/her absences from classes in case of emergencies. Absence in more than 20% of the total number of classes without any application may lead to cancellation of registration of the student in the semester.
 <br /><br />
If a student remains absent in three consecutive classes, s/he must submit an application to the course teacher and must obtain permission to attend the next class. In the application, s/he must explain the exact reason for remaining absent, not just that s/he was not in a position to attend classes for reasons beyond control or had family problems. However, just applying is not enough - the student must submit authentic documents in support of his/her application. All medical documents submitted in support of an application must be attested by Medical Officer of Eastern University. 
<br /><br />
If a student remains absent in 5 or more classes of a course in a semester, s/he must apply to the Dean of the Faculty for obtaining permission to continue the semester/ appear in the examination.
