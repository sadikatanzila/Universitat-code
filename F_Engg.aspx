                The Engineering Faculty has been established, as the engineering graduates are highly demanded to make Bangladesh digital and to earn foreign remittance through their achievements in abroad. Our nation is waiting to see Digital Bangladesh by 2021. In overall consideration, Faculty of E&T is very much committed to produce world-class talented engineers in different engineering programs. A strong group of talented and dedicated faculty members is working here. Besides many senior faculty members of BUET and Dhaka University are also with us. In our faculty, addition to normal course works, we offer extra tutorial classes for each program so that all students can comprehend the courses equally. Our laboratories are equipped with state of the art equipment and software. Our brilliant students of E&T Faculty have crowned with successive success reserving the first position among all private universities of Bangladesh in 2009 and 2010 through their challenging participations in programming contest namely IUPC arranged by IUT and ACM-ICPC arranged by NSU respectively.
