                                It is increasingly being felt today that to pursue a successful career after graduation or even to lead a satiated life a student needs package of knowledge beyond the skills provided by the discipline of his/her expertise. This package of knowledge relate to areas of creative thinking, written and oral communication, quantitative reasoning, technological literacy, knowledge of moral and ethical standards, teamwork, an inquiring mind and a vast storage of information. Most universities foster the development of such scholarship through a set of courses collectively under the title of General Education, indicating the nature of learning provided. 
 <br /><br />These courses, hence, go beyond the area of expertise for which a student may be studying. So that a student of computer science may be required to read courses in literature or a student of English language is required to read a course in physics or mathematics. Typicall they amount to about one-third of the total course load for a student. This exposure to a wide range of subjects prepares the student to face the complexities of the real world where life is played out in myriad ways. 
 <br /><br />The courses are selected purposively to introduce the students to as wide a range of subjects as possible, from philosophy, art and literature to mathematics, physics and biology, to history, economics, sociology, psychology and so on. Normally these are organized around the general intellectual areas like 1. The arts, 2. the humanities, 3. numeracy, 4. physical and/or life sciences, 5. social and /or behavioral sciences, 6. Technology and communications etc.  
 <br /><br />Eastern University, also adheres to these norms and the philosophy of General Education in its curricula. Each student, irrespective of the chosen field of study, is expected to read some courses in General Education. EU currently offers a total of 34 such courses which have prior approval from the UGC and a specified number of these are taught in a given semester. These courses are centrally administered by the General Education (GED) Cell of the Eastern University and are taught by experts in each field. 

 <br /><br /> Students irrespective of their faculties/departments read these courses in the same class, which allows them to mix with students of other disciplines and exchange and share ideas instead of being boxed in a particular setting hinged to a limited set of beliefs and prcatices with little or no exposure to the larger world. Such sharing, therefore, exposes one to unknown, unfamiliar and undiscoved territories and opens up the horizon for novel ideas and creativity, the very objective of university teaching.
