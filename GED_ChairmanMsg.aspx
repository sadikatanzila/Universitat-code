                              Since its inception Eastern University has been offering a set of courses under the heading of General Education (GED) to students of various departments. These were taught largely by the teachers of the same department or in separate departmental settings, for instance the same English language course was taught to students of Business or Law in different groups defeating the very purpose of General Education.  
<br /><br />Of late, however, these courses have been brought under a centralized department and are being taught to students of diverse disciplines in the same classroom, fostering sharing and exchange of ideas among students across the campus. Students are now expected to take courses in other buildings of the campus than their ”own” and get to know and mix with students of the “other” subjects, get exposed to unfamiliar concepts, ideas and beliefs, breaking down barriers and invisible walls they were previously confined within.  
<br /><br />General Education (GED) Cell, thus, opens up vistas and broadens horizons of creativity and learning by offering courses across the campus to students of all disciplines and nurtures a campus-wide culture. Courses are offered to “educate” the soul rather than “teach skills” to do a particular set of tasks. These courses vary from the arts, philosophy, history, language and literature to mathematics and the sciences. They expose the students to an ocean of knowledge. On behalf of the faculty and the administration of the GED Cell, I welcome all to dip their feet in this vast ocean of learning.
