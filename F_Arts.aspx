                Eastern University is about to step into the 8th year of its existence. But in this short period, like the proverbial saying, ‘morning shows the day,’ Eastern has already shown potentials as a sound and an earnest institution of higher learning. Its soundness is that it resists being caught in the Private University market-oriented rat race of proliferating academic programs without first ensuring appropriate campus facilities and academic faculties. Eastern started with four Faculties and is still concentrating on those four. Eastern University believes in not producing, as the present Vice Chancellor always says, many ‘sick children’ for reasons not wholly academic but nurturing the existing ones. Eastern’s physical expansion precedes academic expansion, and not the other way round. The most vital strength of Eastern University is its faculty; it recruits the best available teachers through vigorous search and a rigorous selection process.
                    

                    <br />
                    <br />
I wish Eastern University well in its vision and mission of becoming “a Centre of Excellence” in the region at the possible time.
