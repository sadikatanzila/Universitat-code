  <label style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold">Why learn Chinese language?</label> 
                
                <br /><br />
China has already earned high reputation in higher education leading to Master & Ph.D. degrees. Many students are now studying at universities in China with scholarships given by the Government of China. The tuition fees and living cost in China is much lower compared to North American, European and Australian universities. Many students are also going to study in China with private funding. However, students must learn Chinese Language at a standard level (HSK 4) before enrolling in Bachelor, Master or Ph.D. courses. There is also a great demand for those who know Chinese Language in Bangladesh at offshore Chinese organizations and other organizations involved in business with China.
