                            The Faculty of Law at Eastern University aspires to meet the highest standards of excellence in every dimension and to be recognized as one of the best Law Faculties in the country. We consider the study of law as a liberal training of minds and character, and cultivation of sophisticated intellectual and practical problem-solving skills. The Faculty is committed to producing graduates capable of meeting the legal, political and social challenges of the 21st century, especially in our endeavour to uphold the rule of law in Bangladesh. Hence, it is our mission not only to train students with the highest caliber and integrity, but also inculcate in them leadership qualities with exposure to legal contextual issues. This would, I believe, motivate them to have vision and commitment to society and make them intellectually rigorous and socially responsive.<br />
