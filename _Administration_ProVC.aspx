Eastern University was established in 2003 with an objective to bring “Distinction in Education” with a vision to become a leading University in South Asia. Since its inception, EU has been the pioneer in providing high quality education and committed to developing human capital of our country to face the challenges of the 21st Century. 
<br /><br />
EU is well known for its peaceful academic environment and it is one of the fasted growing universities of our country with a group of dedicated faculty members, who take teaching seriously. EU faculty members are able to motivate students to learn, and encourage them to provide feedback concerning their progress. EU maintains international standrads of teaching to prepare students for successful careers. EU has partnered initiatives with national and multinational bodies to enable students to work in different organizations to gain supplementary knowledge beyond class room learning. In fact organizations employing EU graduates have benefited from their relatively steep learning curves. As a result, organizations that have recruited once from EU continue to recruit EU graduates have proven themselves to be strong leaders, strategic thinkers and exceptional team players who are compatible with the culture and needs of the organization. 
<br /><br />
No matter you are a prospective student or alumni, a guardian or visitor, a student or faculty member, a researcher or staff, an academician or stranger, your interest on EU would be highly valued and always appreciated.
